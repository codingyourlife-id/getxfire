A Flutter project that implemented getx package and firebase services.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

# State Management

GetX : https://pub.dev/packages/get

GetX is an extra-light and powerful solution for Flutter. It combines high-performance state management, intelligent dependency injection, and route management quickly and practically.

GetX has 3 basic principles. This means that these are the priority for all resources in the library: PRODUCTIVITY, PERFORMANCE AND ORGANIZATION.

GetX is not bloated. It has a multitude of features that allow you to start programming without worrying about anything, but each of these features are in separate containers and are only started after use. If you only use State Management, only State Management will be compiled. If you only use routes, nothing from the state management will be compiled.

GetX has a huge ecosystem, a large community, a large number of collaborators, and will be maintained as long as the Flutter exists. GetX too is capable of running with the same code on Android, iOS, Web, Mac, Linux, Windows, and on your server.
